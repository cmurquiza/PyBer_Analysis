# PyBer Challenge Analysis

## The purpose of the new analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the PyBer data, and how the data is different based on city type, and how those differences by fare, driver count, and rides taken can be used by leaders at PyBer.  

## Results:

### There were multiple findings based on this new analysis. In the rural category, you can see there were 78 drivers with only 125 total rides, which indicates that there are many drivers but not as many riders for the drivers to make as much money, and have more opportunities to have multiple riders in their day etc. It is also important to note that the average fare in Rural areas is higher at $34.63 per ride, compared to Suburban at $30.97, and $24.52 in Urban areas. With the riders having to pay more per ride, it could be due to the fact that going to frequently traveled and common locations such schools, hospitals, stores are probably further away and thus costing more to get to their location than compared to Urban locations. Overall though, due to be a rural community and probably not having as much riders to begin with, revenue can be affected which you can see in total fares totaling to $4327.93, and the average fare per driver being $55.48, compared to Suburban total fares resulting in $19,356.33 and average fare per driver at $39.50, and Urban total fares resulting in $39.854.38 with $16.57 in average fare per driver. In the Suburban category, there were significantly more drivers compared to rural drivers with 490 drivers, with 625 total rides, while in the Urban category there were 2,405 drivers with a total of 1,625 total rides. With so many drivers available in Urban cities and a corresponding high amount of total rides,  it is understandable why the average fare per ride and driver would be so much lower as compared to the Rural and Suburban cities due to supply and demand. The same could be said about Urban cities— that due to the close proximity to locations people frequent could be why their average fares per rider and per driver were the lowest compared to the other two categories. Most customers in the cities due to the nature of the city environment, most people may not have cars due to no parking and easy access to other forms of transportation such as PyBer, or buses or trains, which could be why there are so many riders in the Urban areas. Also, Urban areas tend to have a higher population count due to more condensed housing in apartments, etc.

### In the multiple line graph you can see that in all 3 location types had an increase at the same time during the end of February and at the start of April, and all had drops at the start of March. There were many high peaks and drops in the Urban and Rural category, while Suburban had some but was fairly constant.

## Things to further look into:

### There are many things that can be looked into further, such as getting more data to see how many drivers are actually active compared to idle drivers who are registered but aren’t actually driving, to see how many readily available drivers there are. We can explore the question if people are having long wait times for rides, if it can deter other riders from wanting to use the service in the Rural areas, or if having fewer drivers or fewer riders affects the price, or if just the distances to locations affects the price. 

### The environment and way of life per these different living categories are different, and that can be explored to see how these influences and outside factors impact the success and need for companies such as PyBer. Cities can thrive with a ride service such as PyBer due to the nature of city life with parking spaces being scarce, close proximity to most locations or ease of public transportation, higher paying jobs,  while in Rural communities it may be harder due to financial means, distance, or less riders for a variety of reasons. Collecting data to see which gender is using the ride service more in general and per location type can be done, and we can explore why that is. We can as well analyze the trends of peaks during certain months of the year such as the end of February and in the beginning of April, and to see what could be the cause for the fall in fares and rides during certain months. With all of these questions to be further looked into, it can great benefit the decisions the leaders at PyBer can make next.
